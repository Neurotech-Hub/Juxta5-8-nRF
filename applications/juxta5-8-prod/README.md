# juxta5-8-prod

Production Hublink firmware for Juxta5-8 (nRF52840). Combines Hublink GATT BLE, append-only NOR CSV logging, and LIS2DH12 motion/temperature sensing. Settings persist in nRF52840 internal flash. **BLE radiated TX** defaults to **+8 dBm** via `CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_ANTENNA` in the [`Juxta5-8_nRF52840`](../../boards/NeurotechHub/Juxta5-8_nRF52840/Juxta5-8_nRF52840_defconfig) board defconfig (when Bluetooth is enabled in the build).

Repository overview and bring-up apps: [`README.md`](../../README.md). NOR CSV field definitions: [`docs/JUXTA_NOR_Flash_Logging_Spec_v3.md`](../../docs/JUXTA_NOR_Flash_Logging_Spec_v3.md).

## Build and flash

```bash
west build -b Juxta5-8_nRF52840 applications/juxta5-8-prod
west flash
```

RTT console is the primary runtime log (`CONFIG_USE_SEGGER_RTT=y`). Optional: enable JXGA opportunistic gateway advertising at compile time with `-DJUXTA_PROD_ENABLE_JXGA_GATEWAY_ADV=1` (see [Pending](#pending--not-yet-implemented)).

## Defaults (NVS, first boot)

| Setting | Default | Range / notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scan_interval_s` | 30 s | 0 = no passive scan; 1–120 s (clamped on save) |
| `adv_interval_s` | 5 s | 0 = no non-connectable adv; 1–120 s |
| `vitals_interval_s` | 60 s | Vitals timer period |
| `inactivity_multiplier` | 1 | 1–10; scales scan interval after zero-motion vitals window |
| `subject_id` | `JX_XXXXXX` (device ID) | Gateway `subjectId` may override |
| `experiment` | empty | Gateway `experiment` |
| `upload_path` | `/` | Fixed placeholder in NVS blob |

Firmware version **`5.8.0`**; NOR schema **`jxta-nor-csv-v5`** (`JUXTA_LOGGING_VERSION` 5).

## Boot and State Machine

### Boot path

```
Power-on / Reset
      │
      ├─ RESETREAS == 0 (fresh power-on)
      │         └─→ Shelf mode (System OFF, MAG_INT wake). No LED.
      │
      ├─ RESETREAS[OFF] set (woke from System OFF via magnet)
      │         └─→ LED ON while magnet held → measure hold duration
      │                   ├─ < 7 s  → LED off → slow blink → Datetime sync phase
      │                   └─ ≥ 7 s  → 3× blink → fast blink → DFU mode (MCUboot SMP BLE)
      │
      └─ Other (watchdog, pin reset, lockup)
                └─→ Skip shelf/hold, go straight to production init. No LED gate.

After datetime sync (if required), production init requires NOR log + LIS2DH12:
      ├─ NOR or accel init OK  → vitals + scan/adv state machine
      └─ NOR or accel init fail → long blink (1 s on / 1 s off) forever
```

### Datetime sync phase (normal wake only)

```
Slow blink (50 ms ON / 450 ms OFF) — waiting for iOS connection
      │
      └─ iOS connects
               │  LED: solid ON
               ├─ timestamp received via Gateway
               │         └─ wait for disconnect
               │                   └─ 5× blink → LED off → Production init
               │
               └─ disconnect without timestamp
                         └─ slow blink → restart connectable advertising
                                         (loops indefinitely until timestamp received)
```

### Production state machine

```
IDLE
 ├─ scan interval elapsed  → SCANNING (1 s passive burst) → flush JXB rows → IDLE
 ├─ adv interval elapsed   → ADVERTISING (1 s non-conn) → IDLE
 └─ iOS connects           → CONNECTED (radio owned by BT stack)
                                     └─ disconnect → IDLE

(JXGA_ overheard in scan → 30 s connectable “gateway” adv: **disabled** in default build;
re-enable with `-DJUXTA_PROD_ENABLE_JXGA_GATEWAY_ADV=1` or define the macro to 1 in `main.c`.)

Parallel vitals timer (every vitals_interval_s):
  LIS2DH12 temp + SAADC batt_mv + motion count → append JXV row
```

### Scanning vs advertising (operational BLE)

After **production init** (`hardware_ready`), the device never runs **non-connectable advertising** and **passive scanning** at the same time. `**adv_interval_s`** and `**scan_interval_s`** are **any whole-second integer from 0 to 120** (no stepping): **0** turns off that modality; values **> 120** are clamped to **120** when saved. **Opportunistic connectable advertising** after overhearing a `**JXGA_`** name is **disabled** by default (`JUXTA_PROD_ENABLE_JXGA_GATEWAY_ADV` = 0 unless overridden at compile time; default in `[src/main.c](src/main.c)`). A `**k_timer`** (`state_timer`) wakes a `**k_work`** handler (`state_work_handler`) on a schedule; each invocation **tears down** whatever phase was active (stop adv and/or stop scan), returns to an internal **IDLE** bookkeeping state, then optionally starts **one** new phase.

**Phases (mutually exclusive on the radio during normal operation)**


| Phase                                            | What starts                                                                   | How long (`state_timer`)      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Non-connectable advertising**                  | `start_nonconn_adv()` — fast interval, name in AD only                        | `ADV_BURST_MS` (**1000 ms**)  | Broadcast `JX_…` identity so other Juxta units can see us                                                                                                                     |
| **Passive scanning**                             | `start_scanning()` — stops any adv first, 100 ms gap, then `bt_le_scan_start` | `SCAN_BURST_MS` (**1000 ms**) | Listen for peer `JX_…` names; queue events for **JXB** logging after the burst                                                                                                |
| **Connectable “gateway” advertising** (optional) | `start_connectable_adv()` (Hublink, full GATT)                                | `GATEWAY_ADV_MS` (**30 s**)   | When `JUXTA_PROD_ENABLE_JXGA_GATEWAY_ADV` is **1**: after a `**JXGA_`** name is overheard in scan, open a connectable window for an iOS gateway. **Default build: disabled.** |


**Non-connectable advertising burst details** (see `start_nonconn_adv()` and `ADV_BURST_MS` in `[src/main.c](src/main.c)`):


| Parameter                                        | Value                                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Burst wall time                                  | **1000 ms**                           | `ADV_BURST_MS`; `state_timer` stops non-connectable advertising after this window, then returns to **IDLE**.                                                                                          |
| Cadence between non-connectable bursts           | `**adv_interval_s`** (NVS / Gateway)  | **0** = disabled; otherwise **1–120** s (any integer); compared against `last_adv_ts` in whole seconds (`juxta_time_now()`). Scan vs adv scheduling and jitter still apply as in the paragraph below. |
| Cadence between passive scan bursts              | `**scan_interval_s`** (NVS / Gateway) | **0** = disabled; otherwise **1–120** s (any integer); compared against `last_scan_ts` in whole seconds (`juxta_time_now()`).                                                                         |
| BLE advertising event spacing (inside the burst) | **100–150 ms**                        | `interval_min` / `interval_max` = `BT_GAP_ADV_FAST_INT_MIN_2` / `BT_GAP_ADV_FAST_INT_MAX_2` (Zephyr `gap.h`: **0x00A0** / **0x00F0** in 0.625 ms units → **100 ms** / **150 ms** nominal).            |
| AD payload                                       | `BT_DATA_NAME_COMPLETE`               | Local name `JX_…` (`adv_name`); non-connectable, identity-only burst for peer discovery.                                                                                                              |


**When both “due”, scan wins.** After going IDLE, the handler evaluates `**scan_due`** only if `**scan_interval_s` ≠ 0** (`juxta_time_now()` ≥ `last_scan_ts` + effective `**scan_interval_s`**), then `**adv_due`** only if `**adv_interval_s` ≠ 0** (≥ `last_adv_ts` + `**adv_interval_s`**). If both intervals are 0, periodic scan and non-connectable advertising are skipped and the state timer is not armed for them (connectable use cases unchanged). If `JUXTA_PROD_ENABLE_JXGA_GATEWAY_ADV` is enabled, `**do_gateway_adv`** (set when a scanned name begins with `**JXGA_**`) is evaluated **before** `scan_due` / `adv_due`. If nothing applies, it programs the timer for the **earlier** of the next enabled scan vs adv deadline, plus a small **random jitter** (0–999 ms) to desynchronize colliding devices.

**Timing note:** `scan_due` / `adv_due` use `**juxta_time_now()` in whole seconds**, `; `**ADV_BURST_MS`** and `**SCAN_BURST_MS`** are both **1 s** wall-time bursts scheduled sequentially, not divisors of the interval. **Idle-period jitter** (0–999 ms on the next sleep) spreads peer wakeups when many devices use similar intervals; it does not randomize burst lengths.

**While an iOS client is connected** (`ble_connected`), the work handler **returns immediately** — the stack owns the connection; scan/adv cycling resumes from **IDLE** after disconnect (see `on_disconnected` in the same file).

**Magnet shelf path:** if the user holds the magnet (not connected), firmware stops adv and scan, forces **IDLE**, then enters shelf after the debounce sequence — same “radio off before shelf” idea.

### Measured current draw (battery terminals)

Average current **probed at the battery terminals** (µA). Bench setup: **+8 dBm** TX where noted (`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_ANTENNA` on this board); values depend on supply, RF environment, and build. **Est. 40 mAh lifetime** assumes a **40 mAh** LiPo and continuous drain at the stated average: **40 000 ÷ I_µA** hours (then shown as days or hours for readability). Does not include self-discharge, end-of-life voltage, or duty-cycle nuance on sub-minute burst rows. **Scan‑burst rows** below used **3** s `SCAN_BURST_MS` at measurement time; firmware now uses **1** s—expect lower average current (re‑bench to refresh numbers).

## LED patterns (LED0, P0.09)

`CONFIG_NFCT_PINS_AS_GPIOS=y`. Patterns are driven by a kernel timer + work item in [`src/main.c`](src/main.c).


| Pattern | Timing | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Off** | — | Shelf (no magnet), production idle, after successful sync handoff |
| **Solid ON** | — | Magnet held at wake; BLE connected |
| **Slow blink** | 50 ms on / 450 ms off | Datetime sync: connectable advertising, waiting for iOS |
| **Fast blink** | 50 ms on / 50 ms off | DFU mode (magnet hold ≥ 7 s) |
| **Long blink** | **1 s on / 1 s off** (indefinite) | **Hardware fault**: external NOR log init failed, or LIS2DH12 init failed — device does not enter production |
| **Counted blinks** | 3× (DFU entry), 5× (sync OK, magnet shelf) | One-shot sequences via `led_blink()` |


### Hardware fault indication (long blink)

If **SPI NOR** logging cannot initialize (`juxta_log_init`, e.g. flash not ready, recovery/format failure) or the **LIS2DH12** cannot initialize (`init_accel`, SPI, motion IRQ, or interrupt config), firmware logs an error on RTT and enters **`LED_MODE_LONG_BLINK`**: **1 second on, 1 second off**, repeating forever. Production timers, vitals, and the scan/adv state machine **do not** start (`hardware_ready` stays false). The watchdog continues to be fed (10 s period). Power cycle or debug reset is required to retry.

This is distinct from **slow blink** (datetime sync) and **fast blink** (DFU).

## Hublink Gateway Data Exchange

All BLE communication uses the **Hublink service** (`57617368-5501-0001-8000-00805f9b34fb`).

### Characteristics


| Characteristic | UUID suffix | Permissions             | Description                                 |

### File listing (Filename characteristic)

Triggered by `"sendFilenames": true` in a Gateway write, or by writing `"LIST"` to the Filename characteristic directly. The device sends an **indication** with a semicolon-separated list:

```
JXS20260507.csv|2048;JXV20260507.csv|14592;JXB20260507.csv|30720
```

Each entry is `filename|size_in_bytes`. **Size** is the **CSV payload** byte count on File Transfer (no leading filename line, no NOR `#EOF` line in that count). A separate **standalone** File Transfer indication with payload `**EOF`** (3 ASCII bytes) follows all data indications and is **not** included in **size**.

---

### File transfer protocol (File Transfer characteristic)

1. iOS writes the desired filename to the **Filename** characteristic (e.g. `JXV20260507.csv`).
2. The device streams the file as a sequence of **indications** on the **File Transfer** characteristic.
  - Data payloads are **CSV only**: the first line stored on NOR (`filename.csv`) is skipped; indications start at the CSV header row. The NOR `#EOF` line is **not** sent as file bytes.
  - Each data indication payload is up to `min(MTU − 3, 512)` bytes (last chunk may be short).
  - The device waits for each indication confirmation before sending the next chunk.
3. After all data chunks, the peripheral sends **one** final indication on File Transfer whose value is exactly the string `**EOF`** (three bytes — gateway end-of-transfer marker). This is distinct from the Filename listing terminator `EOF` and from the `#EOF` line stored on NOR when a file closes.
4. iOS should request MTU exchange to 247 bytes for optimal throughput (~244 bytes per data indication).

## NOR Flash Layout

Logging schema **`jxta-nor-csv-v5`** ([`src/juxta_prod.h`](src/juxta_prod.h)). JXS event rows include **`adv_interval_s`** (after `scan_interval_s`). Each new JXS pseudo-file leads with a `day_start` row that snapshots current NVS (subject, experiment, intervals) so the day is interpretable from JXS alone, without cross-referencing prior days. JXV and JXB stay strict CSV: a single column header followed by data rows only.

| Region | Address               | Size  | Content               |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| JXS    | `0x000000 – 0x00FFFF` | 64 KB | Settings / events log |
| JXV    | `0x010000 – 0x10FFFF` | 1 MB  | Vitals log            |
| JXB    | `0x110000 – 0x3FFFFF` | 3 MB  | BLE observations log  |


All regions are append-only CSV. Each pseudo-file is physically stored as:

```
JXSYYYYMMDD.csv
unix,event,device_id,subject_id,experiment,fw_version,scan_interval_s,adv_interval_s,vitals_interval_s,ble_name
1715200000,day_start,JX_9B10A1,JX_9B10A1,,5.8.0,30,5,60,JX_9B10A1
1715200000,boot,JX_9B10A1,JX_9B10A1,,5.8.0,30,5,60,JX_9B10A1
```

```
JXVYYYYMMDD.csv
unix,motion,batt_v,temp_c
1715200000,12,3.81,24
#EOF
```

Every new JXS pseudo-file (first boot of a region, calendar rollover, or after a `clearMemory` erase) opens with a `day_start` row carrying the NVS snapshot at file creation. JXV and JXB now contain only their column header and data rows — no `#`-prefixed comment lines — so any CSV parser that splits on commas works without special-casing.

```
JXBYYYYMMDD.csv
unix,observer_id,peer_id,rssi
1715200000,JX_9B10A1,JX_3FA2B7,-62
#EOF
```

Settings and the log-state cache live in nRF52840 internal flash (`storage_partition` at `0xF0000`, 64 KB) via Zephyr NVS.

## Validation checklist

Hardware + iOS session (also summarized in the repo [`README.md`](../../README.md)):

1. Flash `juxta5-8-prod` for `Juxta5-8_nRF52840`; RTT shows device ID, NVS load, NOR init. On the sync-gate connection JXS records `shelf_exit`, then `user_connected`, then `time_set`; after the gateway disconnects, `user_disconnected`; after production init completes, `boot`.
2. Connect (nRF Connect or iOS). Node READ returns camelCase JSON; `firmwareVersion` starts with `5.8`.
3. Gateway `{"timestamp":…}` → `time_set` in JXS (preceded by the deferred `shelf_exit` and `user_connected` rows on the first sync of each boot).
4. Gateway `{"sendFilenames":true}` → Filename indication lists `JXS|…;JXV|…;JXB|…`.
5. Write a filename → File Transfer CSV stream (payload size matches listing) → final 3-byte `EOF` indication.
6. Wait one vitals period → JXV grows. Open a new day's JXS (or after `clearMemory`) and confirm the file leads with a `day_start` row carrying the current NVS snapshot (subject, experiment, intervals). JXV/JXB carry only their column header and data rows (no `#device_settings` lines).
7. Second `JX_XXXXXX` nearby during scan → JXB rows in RTT / NOR.
8. Gateway `{"clearMemory":true}` → NOR erased, `memory_cleared` event; NVS settings unchanged on reconnect.
9. Power cycle → NVS settings and log cache reconcile without full NOR rescan.

## Diagnostics

The firmware emits a per-thread stack/CPU snapshot to RTT every vitals tick
(default 60 s, NVS `vitals_interval_s`) via Zephyr's built-in thread analyzer
([applications/juxta5-8-prod/prj.conf](prj.conf) `CONFIG_THREAD_ANALYZER=y`,
`CONFIG_INIT_STACKS=y`, `CONFIG_THREAD_RUNTIME_STATS=y`). The snapshot is
driven from `vitals_work_handler` in [`src/main.c`](src/main.c) so no extra
thread is created.

Example output (one block per 60 s):

```
<inf> juxta5_8_prod: vitals: thread_analyzer snapshot ↓
<inf> thread_analyzer: sysworkq        : STACK: unused 4612 usage 3580 / 8192 (43 %); CPU: 12 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: main            : STACK: unused 15104 usage 1280 / 16384 (7 %); CPU: <1 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: BT RX WQ        : STACK: unused 1924 usage 2172 / 4096 (53 %); CPU: 3 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: BT TX           : STACK: unused 1108 usage 428  / 1536 (27 %); CPU: 2 %
<inf> thread_analyzer: idle            : STACK: unused 220  usage 100  / 320  (31 %); CPU: 80 %
```

### How to read it

- `usage` is the **high-water mark** since boot — the deepest any call chain
  has driven that thread's stack pointer. Pre-fill (0xAA) means the analyzer
  can detect every byte that has ever been touched, not just current depth.
- `CPU` is averaged since the last sample.

### Thresholds

| Condition                                       | Action                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Any thread `usage > 80 %`                       | Investigate — small headroom, single deep call chain may overrun   |
| Any thread `usage > 95 %`                       | Imminent overrun; bump that thread's stack in `prj.conf` and reflash |
| Monotonic growth across hours                   | Possible recursion or local buffers expanding — instrument that code path |
| `idle` `CPU` collapses to 0 %                   | Some thread is busy-looping; check which one is climbing           |

### Crash signature

If RTT prints garbage with runs of `ª` (`0xAA`) followed by an MCUboot reboot,
that is the Zephyr stack sentinel pattern leaking out of an overrun stack —
the same byte that `CONFIG_INIT_STACKS=y` writes into the unused region. The
**last `thread_analyzer:` block printed before the garbage names the thread
that overran** and how close every other thread was. Capture full RTT to disk
(J-Link RTT Viewer "Log to file" or `JLinkRTTLogger`) so the snapshot survives
a multi-day soak.

### What this does NOT capture

- No persistent crash log on the device. A field unit that crashes still
  reboots clean; the RTT log is the only record. To persist a `fault` row to
  JXS across reboots, a fault handler + retained-RAM scheme would be needed
  (separate work).
- No effect on production: the analyzer is a read-only walk; no NOR writes,
  no BLE radio interaction.

| Daily file rotation         | `ensure_file()` in `[src/juxta_log.c](src/juxta_log.c)`: when the calendar date from `unix_time` no longer matches the active pseudo-file, the previous file is closed with `#EOF` and a new `*yyyymmdd.csv` is created. On each new **calendar day**, the first JXS/JXV/JXB append runs `touch_all_for_calendar_day()` so **all three** types get a dated file for that day. **JXS** new-file creation auto-emits a `day_start` row (NVS snapshot via the existing JXS columns) so the day is self-describing; **JXV/JXB** stay strict CSV (header + data rows only). Requires a valid clock; old files remain until Gateway `clearMemory`. **File-creation guarantee**: any JXS event with a valid clock (the first row written after a sync-gate is the auto-emitted `day_start`, immediately followed by `shelf_exit`) calls `touch_all_for_calendar_day` and creates JXS/JXV/JXB for today; rows logged with `unix_time == 0` are silently dropped. The `boot` row therefore always lands in an existing JXS file |
